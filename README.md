Recap Project 4: Weather & Activities App (Completed)
I created an app that fetches a weather object from an API and conditionally picks activities from a list to display as suggestions. I successfully implemented a feature that enables the addition of more suggestions to the list of activities while also allowing their deletion.

The way I handled data in this app exemplifies the fundamental CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These operations constitute the essential features that any app requires.
